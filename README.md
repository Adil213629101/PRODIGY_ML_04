# Hand Gesture Recognition using CNN

## Problem Statement

The need for robust hand gesture recognition systems is growing with the increasing demand for natural and intuitive interfaces. This project addresses the challenge of developing a reliable model that can effectively recognize and classify different hand gestures. The Convolutional Neural Network architecture is chosen for its ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features, making it well-suited for image-related tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the model is sourced from Kaggle: [Hand Gesture Recognition Database](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog). It consists of a collection of images representing various hand gestures, providing diverse data for training a robust recognition model.
